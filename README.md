A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.
